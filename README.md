### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I built this app with the user in mind, prioritizing a clear and intuitive user interface (UI) to ensure convenience and enjoyment. Key focus areas included:

-Designing a seamless UI for effortless navigation.
-Implementing image caching to eliminate wait times for loading.
-Adding features that enhance user experience and accessibility.

These priorities were chosen to create a user-friendly app that meets their needs and delivers a positive experience.


### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I dedicated about 10 hours to this project, allocated as follows:

-Created a mockup of the app's layout.
-Implemented the visual design without functionality.
-Developed the app's logic and ensured all features were functional.
-Created unit tests and gathered user feedback, making adjustments based on their input.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I opted to exclude certain features to maintain simplicity and avoid performance lags. While concurrency could have addressed potential delays, I chose not to implement it, prioritizing simplicity and efficiency over complexity.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The weakest part is the expansion feature. There's a minor bug where collapsing a section may automatically generate a YouTube link, even if the user hasn’t triggered it. This is an area I plan to improve.

### External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
Yes, I utilized an API library to provide users with directions and instructions directly within the app. This approach eliminated the need for users to click on external URLs, ensuring a more inclusive experience.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I hope this app strikes the right balance between simplicity and functionality. I’ve put a lot of effort into its development and sincerely hope you find it both useful and enjoyable!
